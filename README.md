All getting nearest result  but the training to the model should be improved 



1.	Which model have you used for probability prediction? Explain your model.


A) After cleaning the data, I applied three models to find the accuracy of getting the probability to occur our target column and trained  with that model  but the result is not much accurate. I tried all models like Multi linear regression, Multi layer perception that can be applicable to this problem. But the accuracy we are getting little bit varying some time. Basically the problem is to get the probability so obviously we have to use “regression models” it is not labels to use classification models, I also uploaded the model that is trained with “logistic regression” all went successfully   and I conclusively says that the logistic regression is best fit to predict the probability and we have to  train that model more.
